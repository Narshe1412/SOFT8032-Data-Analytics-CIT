## Part 2
You will notice that the values in the temp column are normalized. It stores
 normalized temperature in Celsius. The values are divided to 41 (max)
 Your objective is to produce a new NumPy array. The new array should be a copy
of the original array (see np.copy) with the real Celsius values replacing the
normalized values for the temperature column.

## Part 3
Generally on a given day the number of registered users outnumber the
number of casual users. Determine the percentage of the days in the dataset
where the casual users outnumber the registered users (You should be able
to do this in 2 or 3 lines of code using a relational operator).

## Part 4
In this question you should provide a new implementation of one of last
weekâ€™s questions using array indexing. The objective of this task is to
investigate the impact of weather conditions on the popularity of the bike
scheme. For each of the 4 possible weather conditions calculate the average
number of rental bikes.
